With evidence of payment, the admission forms are available at the bank as well as from the College Admissionâ€™s Officer. A date for the Entrance Examination is fixed and communicated to the Parents/Guardians through various means of communication. Successful candidates are then offered admission. We only accept students based on merit and as such a prospective student undergoes both a written test and oral interview.</p>
