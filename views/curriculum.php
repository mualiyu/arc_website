						<h3>The Curriculum</h3>
						<p>Our curriculum are students-centered with more emphasis on the development of collaborative teaching and learning practice. The college has a strong and well-structured academic program to enable the students effectively sit for Basic Education Certificate Examination (BECE) at Junior Secondary level and West African Examination Council (WAEC) and National Examination Council (NECO) examinations at the senior secondary level. The college makes use of the curriculum provided by the Federal Ministry of Education and follows suit as it has been updated with time. We strictly follow the curriculum as we harmonize it with both the WAEC and NECO Syllabus. The college also makes provision for extra-curricular activities cutting across areas such as sporting activities, club activities as well as the religious activities of Muslim Students Society and the Fellowship of Christian Students.</p>
