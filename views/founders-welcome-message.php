							<h3><span>Founder</span> WELCOME MESSAGE</h3>
                            <br>
							<p>It is my pleasure to welcome you to Ahmadu Ribadu College, a private secondary school for boys and girls based in Modibbo Raji Road, Shagari low-cost housing estate, Yola, Adamawa State, Nigeria. Ahmadu Ribadu College was established in October 2000 with the motto "Janga a Moda" (Study and be learned). Our guiding principles are inspired by the exceptional qualities of the late educator par excellence, Ambassador Ahmadu Ribadu. It has since grown to become a school community that appreciates, understands, challenges and embraces each child just as they are.
								<br>
								<br>
							
							Ahmadu Ribadu College was established to help groom future leaders who are academically sound and morally upright. The school welcomes all interested and qualified pupils to an atmosphere of inclusivity and service.
							</p>
